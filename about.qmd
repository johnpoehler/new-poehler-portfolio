Hello, my name is John Poehler and this is my R portfolio.

I have recently graduated UNT with a M.S. in advanced Data Analytics and this site will help me showcase my programming abilities in R by way of my Capstone Project named: "Exploring the 'I' in Team: Unveiling the Influence of Individual Players on NBA Team Success".
